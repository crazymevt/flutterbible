/// OAuth client identifiers for Google Drive sync.
///
/// These values come from a Google Cloud project you control — see
/// `docs/google-drive-sync-setup.md` for the step-by-step setup. They are
/// **not secrets** in the usual sense: OAuth client IDs (and the "secret" of a
/// Desktop/Installed-app client) are designed to ship inside the client and
/// are protected by the user-consent flow, not by being hidden. Even so, we
/// read them from `--dart-define` at build time so forks and CI can inject
/// their own without editing source.
///
/// Provide them at build/run time, e.g.:
///
/// ```sh
/// flutter run \
///   --dart-define=GOOGLE_OAUTH_DESKTOP_CLIENT_ID=xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com \
///   --dart-define=GOOGLE_OAUTH_DESKTOP_CLIENT_SECRET=yyyy \
///   --dart-define=GOOGLE_OAUTH_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=zzzz.apps.googleusercontent.com \
///   --dart-define=GOOGLE_OAUTH_IOS_CLIENT_ID=wwww.apps.googleusercontent.com \
///   --dart-define=GOOGLE_OAUTH_WEB_CLIENT_ID=vvvv.apps.googleusercontent.com
/// ```
