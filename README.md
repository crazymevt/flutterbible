# Study Bible (Flutter)

A clean-slate reimplementation of the Clojure/JavaFX Study Bible as a single Flutter codebase targeting **Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux**, with **first-class cross-device sync** as a new capability.

## Download

### ⬇ [Download the latest release](https://github.com/crazymevt/StudyBible/releases/latest)

Always points to the newest version — Android (APK), Windows, macOS, and Linux builds. (Use this link rather than browsing the releases list, which may not show the newest build first.)

**Linux** ships in two forms: a portable bundle (`StudyBible-Linux.tar.gz`) and a Flatpak (`StudyBible-Linux.flatpak`):

```bash
flatpak install --user StudyBible-Linux.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.crazymevt.StudyBible
```

Flathub distribution is planned (see [flatpak/README.md](flatpak/README.md)).

> iOS is supported in the codebase but isn't distributed as a signed build yet — build it from source (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)).

## Features

- **Multi-version Bible reader** — parallel panels, verse selection, version swap, verse-by-verse and flowing paragraph view, highlight bands.
- **Integrated commentaries & dictionaries** — verse-ref lookup, parallel view, multi-dictionary search, tap-a-word lookup.
- **Study tools** — journals, prayer tracker, sermon builder, plan generator, custom notes, and bookmarks.
- **Progress dashboard** — reading coverage + per-book drill-down, reading pace, achievements/badges, time tracker & analytics.
- **Content manager** — install bibles/commentaries/dictionaries from ph4.org; OSIS + MyBible import.
- **Rich media** — local audio/video, YouTube overlay, image lightbox.
- **Cross-device sync** — highlights, notes, bookmarks, journals, prayers, reading progress, and settings synced across devices (using zero-cost file-based sync like Syncthing or cloud folders).

## Architecture

This project strictly follows a **clean layered architecture**:
- **Presentation:** Flutter widgets + Riverpod (thin, no business logic)
- **Application:** Use-cases / controllers
- **Domain:** Pure Dart models, services, sync merge logic (NO Flutter/IO imports)
- **Data:** Repositories, interfaces, Drift SQLite DBs, SyncEngine, HTTP

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter + Dart
- **State Management:** Riverpod
- **Routing:** go_router
- **Local Database:** Drift (SQLite)
- **Sync:** File sync behind a `SyncEngine` interface (LWW merge)
- **Networking:** dio
- **Media:** just_audio, video_player, youtube_player_iframe
