# Study Bible (Flutter)

A clean-slate reimplementation of the Clojure/JavaFX Study Bible as a single Flutter codebase targeting **Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux**, with **first-class cross-device sync** as a new capability.

## Features

- **Multi-version Bible reader** — parallel panels, verse selection, version swap, verse-by-verse and flowing paragraph view, highlight bands.
- **Integrated commentaries & dictionaries** — verse-ref lookup, parallel view, multi-dictionary search, tap-a-word lookup.
- **Study tools** — journals, prayer tracker, sermon builder, plan generator, custom notes, and bookmarks.
- **Progress dashboard** — reading coverage + per-book drill-down, reading pace, achievements/badges, time tracker & analytics.
- **Content manager** — install bibles/commentaries/dictionaries from ph4.org; OSIS + MyBible import.
- **Rich media** — local audio/video, YouTube overlay, image lightbox.
- **Cross-device sync** — highlights, notes, bookmarks, journals, prayers, reading progress, and settings synced across devices (using zero-cost file-based sync like Syncthing or cloud folders).

## Architecture

This project strictly follows a **clean layered architecture**:
- **Presentation:** Flutter widgets + Riverpod (thin, no business logic)
- **Application:** Use-cases / controllers
- **Domain:** Pure Dart models, services, sync merge logic (NO Flutter/IO imports)
- **Data:** Repositories, interfaces, Drift SQLite DBs, SyncEngine, HTTP

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter + Dart
- **State Management:** Riverpod
- **Routing:** go_router
- **Local Database:** Drift (SQLite)
- **Sync:** File sync behind a `SyncEngine` interface (LWW merge)
- **Networking:** dio
- **Media:** just_audio, video_player, youtube_player_iframe
